            Economic Challenges: Worsening Public Debt and Fiscal Concerns
          </h1>
          <p>
            Brazil is grappling with a deteriorating fiscal outlook, despite
            government assurances of achieving primary budget surpluses in the
            coming years. In its 2025 budget guidelines bill, the Lula
            administration set modest surplus targets, starting with 0.25% of
            GDP in 2026 and gradually increasing to 1.25% by 2029. However,
            these projections have been met with skepticism. Gross public debt
            is forecasted to continue rising, peaking at 84.2% of GDP by 2028,
            up from previous projections of 81.8%. This increase is largely
            driven by rising interest rates and mandatory government spending.
            As the article notes, the revision “reflects expectations of higher
            interest rates following an aggressive monetary tightening cycle by
            the central bank to curb inflation, partly fueled by government
            spending” (Ayres). Critics argue that Lula’s fiscal strategy is
            unrealistic, especially in light of the upcoming 2026 election year.
            Investment firm Warren Rena labeled the government's projections
            “inflated,” predicting instead a primary deficit of 0.8% of GDP.
            Moreover, structural pressures, such as growing pension obligations
            and welfare expenditures have raised serious doubts about Brazil’s
            ability to control its debt trajectory. Deputy Treasury Secretary
            Viviane Varga insisted that “necessary measures to deliver these
            results will be taken,” but declined to offer specifics. Meanwhile,
            bond markets are reacting pessimistically, with 10-year sovereign
            yields exceeding 14%, reflecting investor concern over Brazil's
            long-term fiscal health.
