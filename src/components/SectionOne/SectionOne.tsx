            Declining Approval Ratings for President Lula Amid Economic and
            Social Struggles
          </h1>
          <p>
            ​President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, once lauded as "the most
            popular politician on Earth" by former U.S. President Barack Obama,
            is currently experiencing a significant decline in public approval.
            According to a Datafolha poll conducted in February 2025, Lula's
            approval rating has plummeted to 24%, marking the lowest point
            across his three terms in office. This downturn is particularly
            striking given Brazil's positive macroeconomic indicators, such as
            falling unemployment and increased GDP. However, these improvements
            have not translated into widespread public satisfaction. Notably,
            food prices remain high, "with a 40% increase in the cost of coffee
            and an overall 8% rise in food and drinks from the previous year,
            disproportionately affecting Brazil’s working-class citizens" (
            Hughes).​ The administration has also faced criticism for its
            handling of a misinformation crisis surrounding Brazil’s popular
            instant payment system, PIX. A viral hoax on social media falsely
            claimed that PIX would be discontinued. The government's delayed
            response allowed disinformation to spread unchecked, symbolizing a
            broader failure in communication strategy and undermining public
            trust. In response, initiatives like tax relief for low-income
            workers have been launched to rebuild support, but skepticism
            remains high. As the article notes, "Even those who once backed him
            faithfully are now unsure," illustrating the steep political cost of
            unmet expectations. With elections approaching in 2026, Lula faces
            growing pressure to reconnect with a population losing faith in his
            leadership.
